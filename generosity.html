        <p>Generosity was a key feature in the Code of Chivalry. It captures selflessness, and giving without reward, not just of wealth, but of time, effort, work, and compassion. Knights were expected to be generous, protecting the weak, helping the poor, and offering assistance to those in lower positions. Generosity also extended to their friends and fellow knights, fostering companionship and support. By upholding the value of generosity, knights hunted to show their humility, devotion and nobility.</p>
	<p>Knights were expected to uphold a moral duty to serve each other, their lord, king and companions; to protect the poor, and aid those in need. They were to show mercy, honouring defeated enemies, and keeping their dignity even in the middle of a war. Instead of killing or torturing, they would spare their life, or even release the enemy in some cases. If treasure or wealth is gained from a victory, a knight should divide treasure and supplies among all who fought in the war. In the battlefield, generosity was a balance between the danger, and the chivalric values of generosity and honour.</p>

        <p>This is Sir Richard the Lionheart, who was a prominent figure in the Third Crusade. Richard was known for his courage and military power, but also demonstrated significant generosity during his life. Although he was a fierce warrior, he also showed mercy to those he conquered. A famous example of this happened in the Siege of Acre in 1191. Richard captured a large amount of Muslim prisoners, and instead of executing them, which was common, he released many in exchange for ransom.</p>
	<p>Richard was also known to be generous to his own knights and soldiers. He ensured they were well kept, cared for and treated fairly, even throughout the harsh and dangerous conditions of the Crusades. His reputation for generosity, fairness contributed to his beloved and respected position in the medieval period. Even in a time of brutality and war, Richard's acts of generosity, kindness, courage and honour, set his legacy of a chivalrous and noble king.</p>
