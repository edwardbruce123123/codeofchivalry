        <!-- Placeholder for text or information about Loyalty -->
        <p>Courtesy is a central virtue in the Code of Chivalry. It embodies the respect that knights were expected to show to others. This included, women, the weak, those of higher rank etc. Courtesy means more than just being polite, its a way of demonstrating honour, humility, and dignity.</p>
	<p>Knights were taught to be courteous in both action and speech, offering their assistance and respect, without an expectation of reward. On the battlefield, courtesy was a mark of honour and integrity. Knights were expected to show their respect for adversaries, even in a battle. "Noble warfare" meant fighting with courage but not unnecessary cruelty and pain.</p>

        <p>This is Jean de La Valette, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. La Valette is best known for his leadership during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, when the Ottoman Empire tried to capture the island. His actions during this siege showed a profound sense of courtesy, on and off the battlefield.</p>
	<p>La Valette's sense of courtesy was extremely evident in his personal life, and the way he commanded the Knights Hospitaller. Although he was under constant pressure and overwhelming odds, he maintained a calm and dignified attitude, which inspired many knights and the civilians of Malta. A key aspect of his courtesy was his treatment of prisoners. After the battle he displayed mercy toward captures soldiers, offering quarter to those who surrendered or were captured, instead of cruelty or humiliation.</p>
