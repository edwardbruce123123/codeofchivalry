        <!-- Placeholder for text or information about Loyalty -->
        <p>Loyalty was one of the most fundamental virtues in the Code of Chivalry. It demanded a knights unwavering commitment and faith to their lord, king and comrades. This loyalty extended beyond duty, it required knights to place their loyalty above personal desires or gain. A knight's loyalty was tested in times of crisis, when they were called to defend their commitments and oaths, no matter the cost. Loyalty also also involved supporting other knights, standing by their side in battles, and being true to the knightly order.</p>
	<p>Loyalty off the battlefield was equally as crucial as it was on the field. Loyalty wasn't just a matter of military service, it was about being reliable and relentless in all aspects of life. A knight was expected to be completely faithful to his vows, whether to his king, friends, or his own personal beliefs. If a knight pledged loyalty to their lord, they were bound to the oath, having to serve with dedication even in times of peace. Loyalty was essential for maintaining trust and peace in a medieval community, and among knights too, ensuring they could rely on each other in times of disaster.</p>

        <p>This is Sir Godfrey of Bouillon. Godfrey was a key figure in the First Crusade, and was one of the most respected knights of his time, known for his steadfast loyalty to the Christian cause. His loyalty to fellow Crusaders and to his faith was shown throughout the journey to the Holy Land. He was a reliable leader, guiding his troops through rough and difficult terrain. Godfrey always prioritized the welfare and wellbeing of his men, with commitment to each of them.</p>
	<p>Godfrey's legacy is not just about his military successes, but also about his leadership, based on beliefs and loyalty. His life serves as an example of what it meant to be both a true knight, and crusader; driven by loyalty not only to his soldiers, but also to his faith and beliefs. </p>
