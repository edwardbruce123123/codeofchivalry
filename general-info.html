            <p>The Code of Chivalry was a moral and structure that knights followed and based their beliefs on during medieval Europe. Chivalry comes from the old French word, chevalerie. Which means, horse soldiery. Chivalry originally referred to horse-back soldiers, but progressed to a broader group of knights, focusing on the values. </p>
            <!-- You can add more paragraphs or information here -->
		<p>The Code has 7 main values: Courage, Fairplay, Generosity, Courtesy, Honour, Loyalty and Piety.
Courage, the ability to face fear and danger, while still showing bravery. Fairplay, engaging with competition with honour and honesty, ensuring justice and equity. Generosity, being kind and willing to give to others. Courtesy, showing polite and respectful behaviour and values toward all. Honour, representing a strong sense of, ethical, integral and responsible conduct. Loyalty, Demonstrating a strong allegiance and faithfulness to commitments and obligations. Piety, showing a unwavering commitment to God and the catholic church at all times.</p>
		<p>These values are the foundation of life for a knight. But this code was not the official way of life. The code was not a law, nor an official code. These values were social norms, and moral ideas. Knights didn’t need to follow these exactly, there wouldn’t be punishment if they wavered from the code, but the ideal and perfect knight would have followed these rules with no error. </p>
		<p>These laws also heavily influence life today. The idea of honour, loyalty and courage, are the foundation of modern military. Many organisations like the ICC (International Criminal Court) and ICJ (International Court of Justice) are courts that can arrest almost anyone. These are ideas of honour and fair play, so even during war, there are still rules. Fairplay and Generosity are also still used in everyday life, and are extremely important still.</p>
