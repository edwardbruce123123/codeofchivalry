        <p>Fairplay was a fundamental principle for all knights. It emphasizes honour, justice and respect. Knights were expected to fight with integrity, avoiding dishonourable and deceitful strategies. This commitment to fairplay ensured that all battles were fought with dignity, following rules and guidelines. Knights were also expected to show mercy to defeated enemies and uphold chivalrous behaviour at all time.</p>
	<p>In tournaments/sports, fairplay was also a key element. Knights were obligated to engage in combat, with skill, respect, and obedience to the rules, ensuring that the competition would remain honourable. For example, in a fencing match, a knight would avoid striking below the belt or doing deceptive moves. The idea was to demonstrate master and skill of technique, instead of relying on tricks and brute force. Fairplay also meant showing respect to the opponent, acknowledging their skill, and upholding the honour of the tournament. Violating these principles could result in disgrace or a ruined reputation.</p>

        <p>This is Sir James Douglas, also known as "The Black Douglas" Douglas was a Scottish knight renowned for his sense of honour and fairplay during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He was a loyal ally of Robert the Bruce, and fought for him valiantly for the Scottish freedom.</p>
	<p>His most famous moment came after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, where he allowed defeated English knights to retreat safely. Many events of his life demonstrated the principles of fairplay, despite the brutal nature of war. His legacy still remains one of honour and integrity.</p>
