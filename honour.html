        <p>Honour was an extremely prominent concept among knights and the Code of Chivalry. Honour defines the very essence of a knight's character. For a knight, honour was more than just a reputation, it was the core of their identity. Honour was shaped by actions, decisions, and relationships. It demanded a knight act with integrity, loyalty, and fairness in all situations. Upholding honour was often tied to upholding promises, protecting the weak, and fighting for justice.</p>
	<p>In battle, a knights honour reflected in their combat. Avoiding treachery, dishonourable tricks, and cruelty would result in honour. As well as being truthful, keeping your word and loyalty. Off the battlefield, honour meant knights had to live by a moral code, the Code of Chivalry. This meant showing respect, to women, the powerless, and the poor. If a knights honour was ever impure, it was considered a disgrace. This often lead to their downfall or even exile</p>

        <p>This is Sir Bertrand du Guesclin. Guesclin was a famed French knight and military leader during the Hundred Years' War. He believed in fighting with fairness, even when overwhelmed. Guesclin's honour was represented by respect for both allies and enemies.</p>
	<p>His commitment to honour was extremely evident in the way he treats prisoners. He refused to engage in dishonourable or inhumane tactics. he also was very dedicated to defending any civilians, no matter who they were. At one point, Guesclin was captured by the English, but he maintained his honourable lifestyle and dignity. Guesclin is a perfect example of true honour and how its reflected in all of their actions.</p>
